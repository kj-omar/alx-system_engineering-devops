Postmortem: Web Stack Outage
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
The outage lasted for 2 hours, from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM UTC on July 12, 2024.

Impact:
Approximately 60% of users experienced slow loading times or complete inability to access the platform. Services affected included the main application dashboard and the login page. Users were met with 504 Gateway Timeout errors, leading to reduced functionality and frustration. Around 40% of users were unable to complete their transactions or login.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured Nginx reverse proxy, which resulted in an overwhelmed load balancer that could not handle the sudden surge in traffic due to a scheduled marketing campaign.

Timeline
12:00 PM UTC - Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating increased latency and 504 errors.
12:05 PM UTC - On-call engineer confirms elevated error rates from customer complaints and log analysis.
12:10 PM UTC - The team suspected an issue with the application database and began investigating slow queries.
12:20 PM UTC - Database queries ruled out as the cause after query times were found to be normal.
12:30 PM UTC - Investigation escalated to the infrastructure team, as no clear application-level errors were identified.
12:45 PM UTC - Further logs indicated an overworked load balancer.
1:00 PM UTC - Nginx configuration reviewed; discovered that server timeouts were set too low for handling the traffic surge.
1:15 PM UTC - Misleading assumption that application layer optimization would resolve the issue was discarded.
1:30 PM UTC - Correct timeout settings applied to the Nginx proxy.
1:45 PM UTC - Load balancer traffic returned to normal; affected services started recovering.
2:00 PM UTC - All services fully operational, and the incident was resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The core issue was a misconfiguration in the Nginx reverse proxy settings. The timeout settings for upstream requests were too short, causing the load balancer to time out on requests during a sudden surge of user traffic. This was exacerbated by a scheduled marketing campaign that led to a high volume of concurrent requests.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by adjusting the upstream timeout settings in the Nginx configuration file to allow more time for the load balancer to process requests under heavy traffic. Additionally, a temporary increase in load balancer capacity was applied to handle the additional traffic until the timeout change was fully propagated.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Increase proactive monitoring of traffic spikes during planned marketing campaigns.
Review and optimize Nginx and load balancer configuration for high-traffic scenarios.
Implement more robust alerting to catch configuration issues earlier.
TODO:

Patch Nginx configuration to set more appropriate timeout limits for high traffic (e.g., proxy_connect_timeout and proxy_read_timeout).
Add load testing during deployment to simulate sudden traffic surges and monitor system behavior under stress.
Implement traffic rate limiting on the application layer to prevent overwhelming the load balancer during peak times.
Add automated scaling rules to increase load balancer capacity dynamically based on real-time traffic metrics.
Improve internal documentation on Nginx configurations and scaling procedures to avoid future misconfigurations.
Provide training for the engineering team on traffic management and optimizing proxy settings.
This postmortem outlines the timeline, root cause, and corrective actions necessary to prevent a recurrence of this outage, ensuring our infrastructure can handle future traffic surges without service degradation.
Postmortem: The Nginx Apocalypse
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
The Nginx Apocalypse lasted for a nerve-wracking 2 hours on July 12, 2024 (12:00 PM to 2:00 PM UTC).
If you were wondering, yes, that's two entire episodes of your favorite Netflix show.

Impact:
A whopping 60% of users either experienced slower load times than your grandma’s internet or, worse, faced a cold, emotionless 504 Gateway Timeout. Around 40% couldn't even log in or access their accounts—talk about a Monday morning!

Root Cause:
It wasn’t aliens, sadly. A simple misconfiguration in our Nginx reverse proxy settings caused our load balancer to wave the white flag under heavy traffic.

Timeline: When Things Went Downhill
12:00 PM UTC - We heard a ping: "Monitor alert: High latency!" And then the pings didn’t stop… Uh-oh.
12:05 PM UTC - Customer complaints started rolling in. One user described it as "worse than waiting for my pizza."
12:10 PM UTC - The team dived into the logs, pointing fingers at the database, because when in doubt, blame the database, right?
12:20 PM UTC - Turns out the database was innocent (this time). It had a clean alibi—query times were perfectly fine.
12:30 PM UTC - Infrastructure team gets called in: "Hey, we might need your help..."
12:45 PM UTC - We start suspecting the load balancer. Logs reveal it’s running like a hamster on a wheel during a marathon.
1:00 PM UTC - Found the culprit! Misconfigured Nginx timeout settings—oops.
1:15 PM UTC - False start: Tried fixing things on the app layer, which didn't work.
1:30 PM UTC - Applied the correct timeout settings in Nginx. The load balancer breathes a sigh of relief.
1:45 PM UTC - Services begin to recover, and users start rejoicing.
2:00 PM UTC - The apocalypse is over. We live to fight another day.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
Picture this: the marketing team runs a massive campaign. Users flood in, but Nginx has a panic attack. The timeout settings were set too low, causing the load balancer to freak out and time out requests. This led to cascading 504 errors, and users were left staring at blank screens.

Resolution:
We adjusted the timeout settings in Nginx's configuration, giving the load balancer more time to process each request (a bit like giving it a coffee break). We also temporarily increased load balancer capacity to handle the traffic surge while the changes propagated.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
So, what did we learn (besides never trusting default configurations)?

We realized that having a well-configured Nginx is key to avoiding a meltdown during traffic surges.
Traffic spikes from marketing campaigns are no joke. We’ll need to prepare for those in advance.
TODO:

Patch Nginx config to allow more time for traffic handling (because sometimes things just need a moment).
Run stress tests to simulate the chaos of a traffic surge and see what breaks.
Implement rate limiting so that our servers don’t throw in the towel when everyone hits "refresh" at once.
Auto-scale the load balancer based on traffic (because who wants to manually scale during a meltdown?).
Improve documentation (the ultimate "did you try turning it off and on again?" guide).
Team training on handling Nginx and load balancers without causing accidental mini-apocalypses.
